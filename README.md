Lastly, the model equation is:

log(MEDV) = 3.0309 + -0.0763 CRIM + -0.0582 * NOX + 0.0866 * RM + -0.0787 * DIS + -0.0778 * PTRATIO + -0.1944 * LSTAT

After interpreting this linear regression equation, it is clear that the number of rooms had a strong correlation with our target variable, MEDV. That allowed us to create a sufficient baseline variable in our prediction model to help us predict the prices of homes in the Boston Metropolitan Area and have a normal distribution with our test set on the unseen data. Although, our final model had an Rsquared of 75% accuracy on our test set, I believe adding more complexity to the model by introducing more features could potententially allow us to increasing the accuracy of our prediction model even further.
